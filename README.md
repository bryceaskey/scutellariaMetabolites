# scutellariaMetabolites
A brief summary of the goals of this project is as follows:
1. Chemically assay a subset of *Scutellaria* species to identify those accumulating high concentrations of medicinally relevant flavonoids. 
2. Combine chemical and phylogenetic data to provide insight into the evolutionary history of flavonoid diversity, and identify "medicinal hotspots" in the genus.
3. Perform organ-specific chemical profiling to determine differences in site of flavonoid accumulation across multiple species.
4. Apply transcriptomic profiling to identify differentially expressed genes potentially responsible for organ-specific differences in flavonoid accumulation.

Overall, a better understanding of flavonoid diversity and the mechanisms controlling it will facilitate the development of drugs and treatments from *Scutellaria* plants.

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a bookkeeping tool for all of code, data, and figures generated for each part of this project.
